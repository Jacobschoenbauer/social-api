With social network API. I enter the command to invoke the application
then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
 I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia. I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database. I am also able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
